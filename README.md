# Hello-world
Just another test


I believe that if I work hard enough and long enough at something I will acheive.

I am struggling currently with the idea of leaving my mother and girlfriend to pursue what I hope is a better career in London.
I do sincerely hope I do not live to regret this decision anytime soon.
